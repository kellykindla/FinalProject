# Technologies Used
[Return to README](README.md) 
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas version 1.3.5 will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python version 3.8.8.
## Database Storage
PgAdmin4 version 6.1 will be used to access PostgreSQL version 11.14 which is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Tableau version 2021.4.3 to display the data.
## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn version 1.0.2 is the Machine Learning library we'll be using to create a classifier. We will be creating a Linear Regression Machine Learning model thus establishing our dependent and independent variables and training our model with the entire dataset. We can then test our model with the dataset and make predictions on the dependent variable, extrapolating information. We will be using Pandas to preprocess our data for the Machine Learning model. 
## Dashboard
Our dashboard is hosted through Tableau Public.
