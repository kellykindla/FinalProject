## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas version 1.3.5 was used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis was completed using Python version 3.8.8.

## Database Storage
PgAdmin4 version 6.1 was used to access PostgreSQL version 11.14 which was the database we used, and we integrated Tableau version 2021.4.3 to display the data.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn version 1.0.2 was the Machine Learning library we used to create a classifier. We created a Linear Regression Machine Learning model thus establishing our dependent and independent variables and trained our model with the entire dataset. We then tested our model with the dataset and made predictions on the dependent variable, extrapolating information. We used Pandas to preprocess our data for the Machine Learning model. 

## Dashboard
Our dashboard wass hosted through Tableau Public.
